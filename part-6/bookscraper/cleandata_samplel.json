Armed with this knowledge, democratic societies face a defining challenge: fending off a new aristocracy.

Why Save the Bankers? brings together selected columns, now translated and annotated, from the period book-ended by the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Paris attacks of November 2015.
